# UdacityProject1

1. Libraries Used

The following libraries were used for data processing, analysis, and modeling:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computing
matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization
scikit-learn: Machine learning models and metrics
jupyter notebook: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling

2. Project Motivation

In recent decades, we have witnessed the alarming deterioration of public health systems in many countries. Policies of austerity, the privatization of essential services, and chronic underfunding of preventive healthcare have left millions of people without adequate access to quality medical services. This public health crisis not only affects the present but directly threatens the life expectancy of entire generations, perpetuating cycles of poverty, disease, and premature death.

This project was born from the urgent need to highlight the critical connection between public health, access to essential services, and life expectancy. Our aim is not only to identify which factors influence longevity but also to expose how the neglect of public health systems and adverse socioeconomic conditions are shortening lives.

Through this analysis, we aim to answer key questions such as:

Which factors truly affect life expectancy?
Should countries with low life expectancy (<65 years) urgently increase public healthcare expenditure to improve lifespan?
How do infant and adult mortality rates impact life expectancy?
How does educational inequality and lack of access to health information contribute to lower life expectancy?
Can strengthening public health systems and expanding access to vaccines, preventive care, and health education significantly increase life expectancy?
Life expectancy should not be a privilege reserved for those who can afford it — it must be recognized as a fundamental right guaranteed through strong, equitable, and universal public health systems.

3.  Files in the Repository

Data: WHO.csv	
This file contains the dataset used for the analysis. It includes data on life expectancy across various countries, along with health indicators, economic factors, and lifestyle variables that might influence life expectancy.

Docs/README.md	
This document provides detailed information about the project, including its purpose, methodology, key findings, and acknowledgments. It helps guide any user or contributor exploring this repository.

Notebooks/Pro1.ipynb	
This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code for data exploration, cleaning, visualizations, modeling, and interpretation of results. It is the main working file where the analysis was conducted.

4.  Summary of Results

The results of this analysis clearly demonstrate that public health, education, and socioeconomic conditions are key determinants of life expectancy. Factors such as schooling, public health expenditure, and access to preventive care have a significant positive impact on how long people live. Conversely, factors such as HIV/AIDS prevalence, excessive alcohol consumption, and high adult mortality rates significantly reduce life expectancy.

These findings reinforce the urgent need to reclaim and strengthen public health systems as fundamental pillars of social welfare and health justice. Countries that have neglected their public health infrastructures are witnessing a worrying decline in life expectancy, especially among the most vulnerable populations. Without guaranteed access to quality healthcare, health education, and preventive services, good health becomes an unattainable luxury for millions.

To reverse this trend, governments must:

Substantially increase investment in public health, prioritizing primary care and prevention.
Ensure universal and free access to essential medical services.
Promote health education campaigns, particularly in vulnerable communities.
Regulate and discourage harmful practices, such as excessive alcohol consumption, while encouraging healthy lifestyle habits.
Incorporate the social determinants of health into public policy, recognizing that poverty, inequality, and lack of education are also risk factors for poor health.
Restoring and strengthening public health systems is not just a matter of social justice — it is a direct investment in the longevity and well-being of current and future generations. Health must no longer be treated as a privilege; it is and must always be recognized as a fundamental human right.
